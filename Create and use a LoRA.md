# Create and use a LoRA


To start we need two things, the training data and the base model.

* data/
	* game_log1.txt
	* game_log2.txt
	* etc...
* model/
	* Mistral-7B-v0.1/
		* config, safetensorts, tokenizer, etc


Make sure you setup and use a virtual environment with working with python.

```
# Create the venv
python3 -m venv venv

# Start the venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
